This is a small script to check for privilege escalation vulnerablities based on dynamically linked shared object in Linux. It is based on this [https://www.contextis.com/en/blog/linux-privilege-escalation-via-dynamically-linked-shared-object-library | blog post]. It can be used by pentester to quickly check a Linux systems for this privilege escalation route or by system administrator to make sure their library paths don't have weak permissions.
